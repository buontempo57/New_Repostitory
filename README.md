# Hi, I'm buontempo57 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🌱 Learning Journey
I'm currently learning **Git Bash** and working to understand the basics of version control and the command line. While it’s been challenging, I’m excited to keep improving and sharing my progress here.

## 🚀 Goals
- Master the fundamentals of Git and Bash commands
- Build and contribute to interesting projects
- Document my learning to help others in the same boat

## 📚 Resources I’m Exploring
- [GitHub Docs: Getting Started with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)
- [Git Bash Basics](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash)
